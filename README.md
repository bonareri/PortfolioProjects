# PortfolioProjects
This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects that showcase my skills and experience in data science. Each project folder contains a Jupyter notebook and any necessary data files used in the analysis.

The projects cover a variety of topics, including data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. They are intended to demonstrate my proficiency in these areas and my ability to work with real-world datasets.

Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to contact me.
